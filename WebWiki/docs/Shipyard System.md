# Please watch the video to get an understanding of what MES Shipyard is  

[![MES Shipyard](https://img.youtube.com/vi/FdhrYNS9XHA/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdhrYNS9XHA)  

MES Shipyard allows you to sell or construct grids that you own by parking them close to the NPC settlements and then selecting them from a publicly accessible console table.  

## Where can I find these MES shipyard blocks in AaW?  

At almost every civilian settlement (Colonies, Station 27, Rak Station). Small outposts are excluded from this.  

## So can I sell my ships to NPC?  

Yes, you can! You can also sell salvage. (Especially handy if you are playing with Aww scrap.)
